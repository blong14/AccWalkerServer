<div class="content"><h1>What is AccWalker?</h1>

<br />
<p>AccWalker is a joint project between faculty at Winston Salem State University, East Carolina University and University of North Carolina at Greensboro. AccWalker is an application designed to perform complex biomechanical data collections and analyses using mobile handsets. AccWalker uses tri-axial acceleration data collected as the user moves around his or her environment. The data is saved and sent to a server, where a researcher can use a web-based interface containing a data-analysis toolkit to perform non-linear dynamical analyses. </p>

<h2>What is Non-Linear Dynamical Analysis?</h2>

<p>Ask Chris!</p>

<br />
<h2>The 'Raw Data' button</h2>
<br />
<p>Selecting raw data on the app homepage will display the raw acceleration data from a particular trial. This is the acceleration data in the anterior direction collected from the device.</p>

<br />
<h2>The 'Analyze Data' button</h2>
<br />
<p>Selecting analyzed data on the app homepage will display the processed data from a particular trial. This data represents a differentiated time series of the peak-to-peak acceleration data and will display the coefficient of variation for the time series.</p>
